## 🏛️ System Rationale: Why Frontend-First?

EduDash was deliberately built **Frontend-First, Backend-Ready** to solve critical enterprise risks early:

1. **API Contract Preparation** — Abstract async services define complete data contracts (JSON payloads, query parameters) before any backend is written.
2. **Workflow Validation** — Complex multi-portal flows (multi-child switching, assignment pipelines, question paper approvals) are validated in the browser by real users before any database schema is committed.
3. **Layout Stabilization** — ERPs are data-dense and prone to layout shifts. Building the shell first permanently stabilizes nested layout outlets, loading skeletons, and memoization boundaries.

## 🗃️ Folder Architecture

The project has been refactored into a highly modular, cleanly separated architecture:

## ✨ New Features & Modules

### 🎓 Student 360° View
A comprehensive aggregation module for Administrators (`/admin/students/:id`). It provides a complete, unified profile of any student, featuring:
- **Attendance Records**
- **Academic Performance & Results**
- **Parent/Guardian Details**
- **Transport & Route Information**
- **Document Vault**
- **Account & Financial Information**

### 📝 Question Paper Management
A complete end-to-end workflow for examination creation:
- **Teacher Workflow:** Create new papers, save as drafts, and submit for approval.
- **Admin Workflow:** Review submitted papers, with capabilities to approve or reject them based on institutional standards.

---

## 🔀 Backend Readiness & Data Access Architecture

EduDash is currently in the **Contract Freeze Phase**, ensuring it is fully prepared for backend integration.

```txt
  Page/Component
      ↓
  Service (e.g., studentService.getStudentProfile)
      ↓
  Data Provider (getDataProvider → provider.getStudents())
      ↓
  MockDB (mockDB/index.js) → persistence/storage.js
```

### The Backend-Swap Seam
`src/data/providers/` acts as the abstraction layer. The active provider is `localProvider.js`.
**To connect a real backend**: Simply swap the active provider to an `apiProvider.js` that implements the exact same interface (defined in `src/contracts/`) using `fetch()` or `axios`. Zero changes are required in the React UI, Hooks, or Services.

---

## 🏢 Portal Overview

### 🧑‍🎓 Student Portal
**Role**: Data consumer and task executor.
*Dashboard, Courses, Weekly Timetable, Examinations, Assignments, Achievements, Leave Requests, Clubs, Mentor Support.*

### 🧑‍👩‍👦 Parent Portal
**Role**: Auditor and supervisor.
Uses `ChildScopeSwitcher` to view multiple children. Dedicated features for Fee Details and Transport Tracking.

### 🧑‍🏫 Teacher Portal
**Role**: Primary data writer.
*Attendance Mgmt, Assignments, Marks & Exams, Question Papers, Class Timetable, Student Performance, Reports & Analytics, Leave Mgmt.*

### ⚙️ Admin Portal
**Role**: System governance and master data management.
*Student 360, Teachers, Parents, Classes, Subjects, Subject Allocation, Timetable, Examinations, Attendance Overview, Leave Approvals, Fee & Transport Mgmt, Workload Analytics.*

> **Note:** All 23+ admin pages have been fully refactored to use async Services and Data Providers. Direct `MockDB` imports have been eliminated, paying down earlier architectural debt.

---

## 🔄 Cross-Portal Data Flow Examples

### Assignment Submission Flow
1. Teacher publishes assignment in `AssignmentsManagementPage`
2. `assignmentService` writes to provider + creates pending submissions
3. Student sees assignment in task feed and submits it
4. Teacher sees submission for grading in their assignments page

### Question Paper Approval
1. Teacher drafts a question paper and submits it.
2. Admin reviews the paper in `QuestionPapersAdminPage`.
3. Admin approves → state updates to `APPROVED` → Paper becomes available for scheduled exams.

## 🛠️ Database Migration Guidelines

When migrating from localStorage MockDB to a persistent SQL database (PostgreSQL recommended):
- Enforce **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.
- Use `ON DELETE RESTRICT` on master data (Classes, Subjects).
- Create appropriate indexes (e.g., `CREATE INDEX idx_attendance_student_date ON attendance(student_id, date);`).
- Utilize **Soft Deletes** (`deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL`) for auditable institutional entities.

For more details, review [04-database-architecture.md](./docs/04-database-architecture.md).

---

## ⚙️ Application Boot Sequence

`initializeERP()` runs **synchronously before React mounts**:
1. `ensureRequiredKeys()`: Prevents null-access crashes.
2. `checkAndSeed()`: Generates dynamic institutional mock data if missing.
3. `runMigrations()`: Transforms existing mock records to match latest schema version stamps.
4. `validateAll()`: Checks structural integrity before the UI renders.

---

## 🌱 Seed Data System

All institutional data is generated at first load and persisted to localStorage. There is **one source of truth per entity**, located under `src/data/mockDB/seed/`.

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **localStorage Scope**: All data is browser-local. Different browsers/devices do not share data.
2. **Mock Authentication**: Passwords are stored in plaintext in `erp_authUsers` — no hashing.
3. **No Real-Time Sync**: Changes in one browser tab do not propagate to others without a page refresh.
4. **Simulated File Uploads**: File attachment UIs simulate progress locally; no actual file is stored.

---

## 🛠️ Local Development & Setup

```bash
# Clone and enter the directory
cd school-erp-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test
```

### Resetting Seed Data (Development)
When seed data logic changes, clear the browser storage to force a re-seed:
```js
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear();
// Then refresh — new seed runs automatically
```

Once built, `/dist` is fully optimized and ready for deployment to Vercel, Netlify, or AWS S3.
